# Reverse URL Shortener Tool

This Python script is designed to find available short URLs using multiple domains. It generates random alphanumeric paths and checks if the formed short URL is available. It also generates variations of the path by replacing each character with a different one and checks their availability as well.

> Do you use URL shorteners? If so, you are at risk!
